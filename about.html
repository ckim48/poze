          </div>
        </div>
         <p><strong>POZE</strong> has many meanings. At the core it stands for <strong>P</strong>erspective, the human aspiration for a Why. It leads to a gradual <strong>O</strong>ptimization of the 4 dimensions that determine our being, which is required to reach the <strong>Z</strong>enith, our highest self; allowing for Exposure to the reality that is, which conditions the full <strong>E</strong>xpression of our inherent potential.  <strong>POZE</strong> translates as “inner peace” in Haitian Creole. ezop is its counterpart in Action. It corresponds to envision the World that can be, zoom in on your potential to make it happen, orchestrate your resources in its pursuit, and participate fully in life.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4 mt-3">What</h2>

              <p>POZE is a paradigm to experience our environment differently. It entails a multidisciplinary methodology to identify and live up to our potential, and become an agent of social change. POZE@ezop combines this perspective with a space to making it happen, within a dynamic for change.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Why</h2>

              <p>Anchored in the 4 universal principals of Change (everything continuously evolves), Connection (everything is linked, nothing happens in a vacuum), Continuum (everything is part of a whole ) and Complementarity (everything needs something else to be complete) Change occurs in two, mutually reinforcing, directions:</p>

          <div class="d-md-flex post-entry-2 half mt-5">
            <div class="pe-md-5 mt-4 mt-md-0">
              <!-- <div class="post-meta mt-4">Mission &amp; Vision</div> -->
              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">How</h2>

              <p>To facilitate the transition from theory to practice POZE offers 4 programs:</p>

              <p><span class="text-it">Purpose for Power (P4P)</span> equips individuals with tools to identify and pursue their purpose in life. Knowing WHY we are here, WHO we are, WHERE we are and WHAT we must do to align our aspirations and actions unlocks our innate power. Primary audiences are young people, the elderly, teachers and social workers. Central entry points for exposing these stakeholder groups to the approach include school curricula, parental education programs, kindergartens and schools, retirement residences and employee well-being programs.</p>
<p><span class="text-it">Compassion for Change (C4C)</span> supports institutions seeking to reignite compassion and purpose among their staff. A focus is placed on those involved in social change efforts. By reconnecting individual staff members with their personal desire for meaning, C4C offers a bridge between individual and institutional missions, and tools to bring them in synch. As individual staff find fulfilment in their work, they invest their best self, thereby enabling the organization to live up to its mandate and the potential of contributing to social change.</p>
<p><span class="text-it">Honesty for Humility (H4H)</span> is a coaching approach for leaders at all levels and in all sectors. It helps those at the top to reconnect with their roots; the aspiration to make a difference. As participants re-align their aspirations and action, their words and works, they inspire those under their headship; by manifesting the values they expect in others. </p>
<p><span class="text-it">Influence for Impact (i4i)</span> seeks to Inspire, Induce, Intrigue and Ignite by addressing aspirations, emotions, thoughts and sensations to bring about readiness for change. i4i supports the design of communication efforts that accompany audiences from being interested in a cause, to understanding the issues underneath, to having a personalized feeling about the cause, to caring enough about the affected people to personally get involved in order to change the situation. It offers organizations committed to social change a methodology to shape decision-making architectures that are conducive to new mental habits, which translate gradually to new social norms of compassion and solidarity. There are many ways to implement i4i, including using AI to design aspirational algorithms tailored into for integrated life-cycle coaching.</p>
<p><strong>POZE</strong> is a paradigm to see and a methodology to live life differently. It comes from the understanding that our existence involves twice 4 dimensions. The 4 individual dimensions (soul, heart, mind, body) are symmetrical to the 4 collective dimensions that shape our reality – micro (individuals), meso (communities), macro (countries) and meta (Planet Earth). Whatever happens in one dimensions influences the others, directly or indirectly, now or later. Changing the course of Planet Earth begins with individual action. It starts with you and me. Today.</p>
